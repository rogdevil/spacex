spacex challenge
How to Run:
This project is initialized with vite so you can use `yarn && yarn dev`
My thoughts on project-
The experience was pretty good except for the rate limiting in the api ...

1. the video links cannot be embeded in the video tag
2. the graphql api is rate limited and you can only access the data upto a certain length and depth I had to remove the rocket info from the query for my fetch requests to work
3. The Image urls on multiple fetch started send 403 forbidden which is a pain as you start questiong yourself while debugging lol :P

If I had time I would definately like to work on UI and UX ... consider the api is limiting my ability to develop so idk may be add some cool animations and increase user accessiblity
Unable to add search for rocket name as I have to remove that from shcema in order for query to work
